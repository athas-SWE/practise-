OOP provides access specifiers and data hiding features for more security
 and control data access,
 overloading can be achieved with function

 Inheritance means one class (sub class) acquiring properties
 of another class (super class) by inheritance.

Polymorphism is an ability to have multiple forms or 
capability of the method to do different things.
